Why “enqack [^1]”?

**ENQ** (*Enquiry*, `^E`, `0x05`) asks “Who are you?” or in the case of learning "What are you?"

**ACK** (*Acknowledge*, `^F`, `0x06`) replies “Heard you.” or in the case of learning "Lets get started."

[^1]: Pronounced En-Ack. The q being silent given there is no u afterwards.
[^2]: The order does not signify level of expertise.
[^3]: For distribution that use Systemd I would argue it's an appropriate moniker to expand upon the often used GNU/Linux moniker.
